%% 1. compute the LUBs for the concept
%% 2. using the LUBs as roots, compute the GLBs
%% 
%% If 1. and 2. result in a single concept and it's the same in both cases, then we
%% have an Eq.
%%
%% 3. remove any subsumptions between any of the GLBs and LUBs
%% 4. add any new subsumptions given in the GLBs and LUBs not already accounted for
%%    by definitions
%%
%% Normally this requires marking algorithms to make it efficient, detect diamonds, etc..
%% it's not clear how to pull this off without writing some temporary bits in the cask
