## onty -- A simple couchapp designed to exercise the APIs of bitstore

Currently there's nothing here except a sample of various javascript codes I've glommed off the web, to help learn the ins and outs of JS.

The idea is to have a very simple [couchapp](http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp) that allows navigation of an ontology using a tree widget and simple searching and editing of concepts.

**Comments** I find it interesting that for the maturity of JS and all the packages out there, there are still few tree widgets.
